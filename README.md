## High fives

If you enjoyed using stardev and would like to support the project, it would be great if you could tweet / facebook / reddit / etc about it!
If you include my twitter `@oliyh` then I will get to see it, too :)

The project does have server costs and I develop it in my free time so if you would like to help make that more sustainable then you can [:heart: Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/oliyh) the project.

## Issues

### Common issues

#### My repo is marked with the incorrect language
The repo language is read from Github. which uses a library called Linguist to calculate it. You can give Linguist hints - see the [README](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist).

#### My page says "This record has been archived"
There was an issue reading your account from Github which made it appear that your Github account had been deleted. Press the "Re-sync" link at the bottom of the page and you will be able to request a re-sync of your profile which should resolve the issue.

#### An account or repo is missing from the rankings
It may be that the account was archived. If it is your account, see above. If it is not, it should be corrected automatically shortly.
The other reason could be due to misclassification of the repo language. If it is your account, see above.

### Other issues
