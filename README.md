## High fives

If you enjoyed using stardev and would like to support the project, it would be great if you could tweet / facebook / reddit / etc about it!
If you include my twitter `@oliyh` then I will get to see it, too :)

## Issues

If you find something that seems wrong please tell me about it by [creating an issue](/issues/new). Including links to stardev/github or screenshots will really help me diagnose it.

## Feature requests

If you've got an idea for making stardev better I'm interested to hear - [create an issue](/issues/new) and let me know about it.
