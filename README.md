Feedback for https://stardev.io

## High fives

If you enjoyed using stardev and would like to support the project, it would be great if you could tweet / facebook / reddit / etc about it!
If you include my twitter `@oliyh` then I will get to see it, too :)

The project does have server costs and I develop it in my free time so if you would like to help make that more sustainable then you can [:heart: Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/oliyh) the project.

## Issues

### Common issues

#### My page says "This record has been archived"
There was an issue reading your profile from Github which made it appear that your Github account had been deleted. Press the "Re-sync" link at the bottom of the page and you will be able to request a re-sync of your profile which should resolve the issue.

### Other issues

If you find something that seems wrong please tell me about it by [creating an issue](https://github.com/oliyh/stardev-feedback/issues/new). Including links to stardev/github or screenshots will really help me diagnose it.
